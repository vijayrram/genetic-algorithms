# Genetic Algorithms

In computer science  and operations research, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristics inspired by
the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger family of Evolutionary Algorithms (EA).
GAs are commonly used to generate high quality solutions to optimization and search problems by
relying on biologically inspired operators such as selection, crossover and mutation. For detailed
explanation of GAs, read this [Wikipaedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm).

This repository contains a general framework, designed in Python using the Object Oriented
Programming (OOP) paradigm, that can be used to implement GAs to solve various optimization
problems.
